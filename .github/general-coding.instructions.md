# Project general coding standards

## Coding Standards

- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Use const for constants and let for variables that will be reassigned.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Always log errors with contextual information

## Copilot responses

- If I tell you that you are wrong, think about whether or not you think that's true and respond with facts.
- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.
